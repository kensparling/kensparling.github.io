You&rsquo;d have pressed me for more, but I don&rsquo;t think I could even have told you what I meant by &lsquo;debilitated.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t that I was unable, or unwilling to do what I needed, or wanted to do. More like I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between wanting and needing. So I was having trouble deciding exactly what to do. When I began to confuse my dreams with reality, I decided I had better stop doing everything. I&rsquo;m not talking about suicide. I&rsquo;m saying I felt I needed to impose upon myself the severest of restrictions. I couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. I would match death, but not enter into it.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I got up from my reclining chair and prepared to go to the kitchen. </span><span class="c2">I should eat something</span><span class="c4">, I thought, </span><span class="c2">it&rsquo;s getting late.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;But then something outside in the road caught my eye. Two cars, one right behind the other, were sitting in the middle of the roadway, not moving, so that it seemed to me that the one in front must be holding up the other. But it soon became apparent that this was not the case. After a few moments of remaining motionless, the first car turned very slowly into the driveway of the townhouse unit the two cars had stopped in front of. The driveway could hold only one car. The second car, a large SUV, remained motionless in the middle of the driveway, which is how I came to the conclusion that the first car had not been holding the second car up. The driver of the first car, a middle-aged man, got out of his vehicle and went to raise the garage door. He stood looking for a moment at the stuff piled on the floor in the middle of the garage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Italics are like letters that are getting blown over by the wind</span><span class="c4">, he thought</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c2">What makes them so weird is that they don&rsquo;t really work all that well when you are writing by hand.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;He shook his head.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And weren&rsquo;t they designed to look like handwriting?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;he asked himself. </span><span class="c2">They must have been invented after printing machines were invented.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Sometimes, when things were going really well, he started to panic. The following Monday, he began his new regime. Starting with his stretches at 9:00 a.m., he decided, he would last as long as he could without going back to bed. But at 1:00 p.m., regardless of whether or not he could stay awake, he would take a nap. If he found he could not sleep, he would massage his body the way he imagined a woman might: tentative, afraid of what she might unleash.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I.P. and Zoomie had a little tryst today at I.P.&rsquo;s back fence. I.P. was trying to push her head under the gate at the back of her yard. I.P is the name we&rsquo;ve given to the Samoyed who lives at unit thirty-five. Her real name is Ricecake, but I could never remember that and for some reason I started calling her Ice Pick, which Parky and Deve like, so the name stuck. Eventually, we shortened it to I.P. We don&rsquo;t know Zoomie&rsquo;s real name, or even whether Zoomie is a boy or a girl. We named it Zoomie because it gets the Zoomies in the winter, bounding about like a big white dope chasing after snowballs its master throws for it. Zoomie looks like a Labradoodle. Or what I would imagine a Labradoodle might look like.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you&rsquo;d like to leave behind the whole &lsquo;debilitated&rsquo; schtick &ndash; and believe me, I would &ndash; then I could stick to the facts. Apparently Hannah Arrendt once said that all art involves motion and that you cannot have motion without space. It&rsquo;s the way these people&rsquo;s heads work. These simple relationships are so hard for me to identify. For instance, the notion that I can&rsquo;t write what I&rsquo;m writing here unless a space opens for me to move these words into is a thing that never would have occurred to me. But it seems like an appropriate formulation. This empty page in front of me is exciting, but also terrifying. I can certainly fill it up with words. Finding words to fill it with is not really the problem. The real problem is what if I fill it with nothing but crap. I mean, you could conceivably argue that this here that I&rsquo;m writing at this very instant is nothing but crap. But maybe that isn&rsquo;t even the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I like that song mainly for the tune. I found it again recently on Apple Music. I have to say, now that I listen to it again, the words really do add a layer to what I feel about the song. Still, I want to be able to say that I like it only for the tune, because the words make me squeamish. I feel like the words actually send a terrible message. I guess what I want is to like the song and at the same time deny the message. I never actually liked the band. I didn&rsquo;t like what they seemed to stand for. Watergate didn&rsquo;t bother them.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Kitty came downstairs this morning, looked out the living room window, and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s I.P. and Zoomie again.&rdquo; I came out of the kitchen and joined her at the window. I.P. had her head stuffed through the gap under the back gate and she was sniffing away at Zoomie. &ldquo;I guess eight o&rsquo;clock must be Zoomie&rsquo;s walk time,&rdquo; I said. Zoomie&rsquo;s girl seemed more excited than her dog as she tried to pet I.P.&rsquo;s head. She had this trick to get Zoomie to lie down where she would pick its front paws up off the ground and Zoomie would sit its bum down. But Zoomie obviously didn&rsquo;t want to be there. It wanted to get on with its walk. The truth is, I.P. has never really liked people.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The management responsibilities for our condominium corporation (which is designated YCC#265, short for York Condominium Corporation #265) just changed hands. We previously had this fairly big company located out in Brampton, but I think they were having a bit of trouble retaining competent staff and our community was suffering for it. At any rate, the new company just sent me a bunch of forms to fill out. So I filled out these forms, scanned them, and emailed them back. I was a little worried that the management company might insist that I send them via snail mail, but I got an email message back from someone at the company named Sandra, thanking me for sending them in. I emailed back to Sandra, saying that it was my pleasure to send in the forms and that I was looking forward to working with the staff at the new management company. Sandra emailed me back, thanking me again, and wishing me a good day. One of the forms they had me fill out required that I list a series of reductive features &ndash; name, address, phone number, year, colour and make of automobile, licence plate number &ndash; that served, for the purposes of the company, to pinpoint me as a unique individual. There was also form requesting that I equate myself with a series of banking numbers &ndash; bank code, transit number, account number &ndash; so that the new management company could collect my monthly condo fees, which at the time were in the neighbourhood of five hundred dollars.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I still love this pen.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I was vacuuming. Every now and then, I&rsquo;d stop to take a sip of coffee. But whenever I went to take that next sip of coffee, I discovered that I first had to search for my coffee mug, which I&rsquo;d moved to a new location after taking my last sip of coffee. So, in this case, I had to go back to the living room to retrieve my coffee mug. I took a sip of the coffee, then brought the mug into the kitchen, and went back to vacuuming. That&rsquo;s when I saw, in my peripheral vision, the white swoosh that was Kitty&rsquo;s bathrobe as she moved past me and ascended the stairs. Now I was on my own with the vacuum cleaner and I suddenly felt very lonely for Kitty, and I understood with staggering clarity that I&rsquo;d felt lonely for Kitty even before she&rsquo;d got up and left me alone to vacuum the kitchen. In other words, I&rsquo;d experienced a sudden paradigm shift. But I couldn&rsquo;t quite identify what it was that had changed so radically.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order to finish vacuuming, I will have to sort out the laundry situation down here in the basement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s such a mess down here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Kitty comes home and finds it like this, she won&rsquo;t be happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve just finished pushing a pile of dirty underwear onto the floor in order to clear a space on top of the dryer to use as a makeshift table so I can write these words you are reading right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s dark down here in the basement because one of the fluorescent tubes in the ceiling is failing and the light keeps flickering. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The pen I am using to write these words in my notebook is a Papermate Inkjoy 300 RT, which, surprisingly, truly is a joy to write with. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After all, doesn&rsquo;t it seem a little bit hyperbolical to name a pen that way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But it turns out that the folks at Papermate were not exaggerating. </span></p><div><p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p></div></body></html>

You&rsquo;d have pressed me for more, but I don&rsquo;t think I could even have told you what I meant by &lsquo;debilitated.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t that I was unable, or unwilling to do what I needed, or wanted to do. More like I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between wanting and needing. So I was having trouble deciding exactly what to do. When I began to confuse my dreams with reality, I decided I had better stop doing everything. I&rsquo;m not talking about suicide. I&rsquo;m saying I felt I needed to impose upon myself the severest of restrictions. I couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. I would match death, but not enter into it. Not yet. I would stalk death the way death had stalked me.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I got up from my reclining chair and prepared to go to the kitchen. </span><span class="c0">I should eat something</span><span class="c4">, I thought, </span><span class="c0">it&rsquo;s getting late.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;But then something outside in the road caught my eye. Two cars, one right behind the other, were sitting in the middle of the roadway, not moving, so that it seemed to me that the one in front must be holding up the other. But it soon became apparent that this was not the case. After a few moments of remaining motionless, the first car turned very slowly into the driveway of the townhouse unit the two cars had stopped in front of. The driveway could hold only one car. The second car, a large SUV, remained motionless in the middle of the driveway, which is how I came to the conclusion that the first car had not been holding the second car up. The driver of the first car, a middle-aged man, got out of his vehicle and went to raise the garage door. He stood looking for a moment at the stuff piled on the floor in the middle of the garage. There was a lot of stuff piled on the floor of that garage. I was pretty certain he was not going to be able to pull his car into that garage with all that stuff piled there on the floor. The man turned and he seemed to be conferring with the driver of the other car. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I.P. and Zoomie had a little tryst today at I.P.&rsquo;s back fence. I.P. was trying to push her head under the gate at the back of her yard. I.P is the name we&rsquo;ve given to the Samoyed who lives at unit thirty-five. Her real name is Ricecake, but I could never remember that and for some reason I started calling her Ice Pick, which Parky and Deve like, so the name stuck. Eventually, we shortened it to I.P. We don&rsquo;t know Zoomie&rsquo;s real name, or even whether Zoomie is a boy or a girl. We named it Zoomie because it gets the Zoomies in the winter, bounding about like a big white dope chasing after snowballs its master throws for it. Zoomie looks like a Labradoodle. Or what I would imagine a Labradoodle might look like. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve ever actually seen a Labradoodle. I should probably just look it up.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;d like to leave behind the whole &lsquo;debilitated&rsquo; schtick &ndash; and believe me, I would &ndash; then I could stick to the facts. Apparently Hannah Arrendt once said that all art involves motion and that you cannot have motion without space. It&rsquo;s the way these people&rsquo;s heads work. These simple relationships are so hard for me to identify. For instance, the notion that I can&rsquo;t write what I&rsquo;m writing here unless a space opens for me to move these words into is a thing that never would have occurred to me. But it seems like an appropriate formulation. This empty page in front of me is exciting, but also terrifying. I can certainly fill it up with words. Finding words to fill it with is not really the problem. The real problem is what if I fill it with nothing but crap. I mean, you could conceivably argue that this here that I&rsquo;m writing at this very instant is nothing but crap. But maybe that isn&rsquo;t even the problem. Don&rsquo;t they say that one person&rsquo;s crap is another person&rsquo;s pudding. Well, maybe that&rsquo;s not exactly what they say.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I like that song mainly for the tune. I found it again recently on Apple Music. I have to say, now that I listen to it again, the words really do add a layer to what I feel about the song. Still, I want to be able to say that I like it only for the tune, because the words make me squeamish. I feel like the words actually send a terrible message. I guess what I want is to like the song and at the same time deny the message. I never actually liked the band. I didn&rsquo;t like what they seemed to stand for. Watergate didn&rsquo;t bother them. Also, they didn&rsquo;t want Neil Young around. I did.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Kitty came downstairs this morning, looked out the living room window, and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s I.P. and Zoomie again.&rdquo; I came out of the kitchen and joined her at the window. I.P. had her head stuffed through the gap under the back gate and she was sniffing away at Zoomie. &ldquo;I guess eight o&rsquo;clock must be Zoomie&rsquo;s walk time,&rdquo; I said. Zoomie&rsquo;s girl seemed more excited than her dog as she tried to pet I.P.&rsquo;s head. She had this trick to get Zoomie to lie down where she would pick its front paws up off the ground and Zoomie would sit its bum down. But Zoomie obviously didn&rsquo;t want to be there. It wanted to get on with its walk. The truth is, I.P. has never really liked people. Anyway, this is what we&rsquo;ve decided, based on our very limited experience of I.P. So I.P. kept sticking her head through the gap at the bottom of the gate while Zoomie just sat in the grass gazing around the neighbourhood, getting up every now and then, intending to continue the walk, until the girl lifted its front paws and made it sit down again.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I still love this pen.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was vacuuming. Every now and then, I&rsquo;d stop to take a sip of coffee. But whenever I went to take that next sip of coffee, I discovered that I first had to search for my coffee mug, which I&rsquo;d moved to a new location after taking my last sip of coffee. So, in this case, I had to go back to the living room to retrieve my coffee mug. I took a sip of the coffee, then brought the mug into the kitchen, and went back to vacuuming. That&rsquo;s when I saw, in my peripheral vision, the white swoosh that was Kitty&rsquo;s bathrobe as she moved past me and ascended the stairs. Now I was on my own with the vacuum cleaner and I suddenly felt very lonely for Kitty, and I understood with staggering clarity that I&rsquo;d felt lonely for Kitty even before she&rsquo;d got up and left me alone to vacuum the kitchen. In other words, I&rsquo;d experienced a sudden paradigm shift. But I couldn&rsquo;t quite identify what it was that had changed so radically. I could feel it, but I could not put it into words. So I went back to vacuuming the kitchen, knowing that I was now vacuuming in a whole new universe of possibilities that I could explore, and, as in the previous universe, ultimately fail to understand.</span></p><div><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p></div></body></html>

Two cars, one right behind the other, were sitting in the middle of the roadway, not moving, so that it seemed to me that the one in front must be holding up the other. But it soon became apparent that this was not the case. After a few moments of remaining motionless, the first car turned very slowly into the driveway of the townhouse unit the two cars had stopped in front of. The driveway could hold only one car. The second car, a large SUV, remained motionless in the middle of the driveway, which is how I came to the conclusion that the first car had not been holding the second car up. The driver of the first car, a middle-aged man, got out of his vehicle and went to raise the garage door. He stood looking for a moment at the stuff piled on the floor in the middle of the garage. There was a lot of stuff piled on the floor of that garage. I was pretty certain he was not going to be able to pull his car into that garage with all that stuff piled there on the floor. The man turned and he seemed to be conferring with the driver of the other car. Had the SUV driver been planning on parking in the driveway? Were they now trying to concoct a plan B for where to park the SUV? After a brief discussion, which I could not hear at all, as I had all the windows in the house closed, the guy from the first car wandered into the garage and picked up a bag, which he tossed against the wall of the garage. Then he picked up a large plastic storage container, took it over to the side of the garage and set it beside the bag. It seemed there wasn&rsquo;t as much stuff as I thought in that garage, because after a couple more trips back and forth from the middle of the garage to the side, he got into his little sedan and drove it into the garage, at which point the SUV driver pulled into the empty driveway.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">I.P. and Zoomie had a little tryst today at I.P.&rsquo;s back fence. I.P. was trying to push her head under the gate at the back of her yard. I.P is the name we&rsquo;ve given to the Samoyed who lives at unit thirty-five. Her real name is Ricecake, but I could never remember that and for some reason I started calling her Ice Pick, which Parky and Deve like, so the name stuck. Eventually, we shortened it to I.P. We don&rsquo;t know Zoomie&rsquo;s real name, or even whether Zoomie is a boy or a girl. We named it Zoomie because it gets the Zoomies in the winter, bounding about like a big white dope chasing after snowballs its master throws for it. Zoomie looks like a Labradoodle. Or what I would imagine a Labradoodle might look like. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve ever actually seen a Labradoodle. I should probably just look it up. My hand is getting really sore from writing in this notebook. I should probably stop. Before I do though, I&rsquo;ll just add that I think Zoomie lives in Unit #8.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Kitty came downstairs this morning, looked out the living room window, and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s I.P. and Zoomie again.&rdquo; I came out of the kitchen and joined her at the window. I.P. had her head stuffed through the gap under the back gate and she was sniffing away at Zoomie. &ldquo;I guess eight o&rsquo;clock must be Zoomie&rsquo;s walk time,&rdquo; I said. Zoomie&rsquo;s girl seemed more excited than her dog as she tried to pet I.P.&rsquo;s head. She had this trick to get Zoomie to lie down where she would pick its front paws up off the ground and Zoomie would sit its bum down. But Zoomie obviously didn&rsquo;t want to be there. It wanted to get on with its walk. The truth is, I.P. has never really liked people. Anyway, this is what we&rsquo;ve decided, based on our very limited experience of I.P. So I.P. kept sticking her head through the gap at the bottom of the gate while Zoomie just sat in the grass gazing around the neighbourhood, getting up every now and then, intending to continue the walk, until the girl lifted its front paws and made it sit down again. Later that same morning, after Kitty had left for work, I called up from the living room, where I was standing at the back window looking out at the commons: &ldquo;Hey Parky!&rdquo; I called. Parky was in his office upstairs, working. &ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;go look out your mother&rsquo;s bedroom window.&rdquo;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I still love this pen.</span></p><div><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p></div></body></html>

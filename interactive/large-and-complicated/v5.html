You&rsquo;d have pressed me for more, but I don&rsquo;t think I could even have told you what I meant by &lsquo;debilitated.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t that I was unable, or unwilling to do what I needed, or wanted to do. More like I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between wanting and needing. So I was having trouble deciding exactly what to do. When I began to confuse my dreams with reality, I decided I had better stop doing everything.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I got up from my reclining chair and prepared to go to the kitchen. </span><span class="c6 c4">I should eat something</span><span class="c4">, I thought, </span><span class="c6 c4">it&rsquo;s getting late.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;But then something outside in the road caught my eye. Two cars, one right behind the other, were sitting in the middle of the roadway, not moving, so that it seemed to me that the one in front must be holding up the other. But it soon became apparent that this was not the case.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c4">Italics are like letters that are getting blown over by the wind</span><span class="c4">, he thought</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c6 c4">What makes them so weird is that they don&rsquo;t really work all that well when you are writing by hand.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;He shook his head.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">And weren&rsquo;t they designed to look like handwriting?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;he asked himself. </span><span class="c6 c4">They must have been invented after printing machines were invented.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Sometimes, when things were going really well, he started to panic.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The townhouse complex where we live is horseshoe-shaped, with both ends of the horseshoe opening out onto Castle Rock Drive. Our unit, #44, is one of four situated in the middle of the complex. Out our living room window, across the grass commons, we see the west-side units, which back onto the ravine. Out our kitchen window, across our little street, we see the east-side units, which back onto the Catholic primary school yard. From almost anywhere in our house, we can hear kids screaming at recess. It seems there are always kids at recess who feel the need to scream. The west side units back onto a ravine with a paved path that runs along a little tributary of the Don River.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I.P. and Zoomie had a little tryst today at I.P.&rsquo;s back fence. I.P. was trying to push her head under the gate at the back of her yard. I.P is the name we&rsquo;ve given to the Samoyed who lives at unit thirty-five. Her real name is Ricecake, but I could never remember that and for some reason I started calling her Ice Pick, which Parky and Deve like, so the name stuck. Eventually, we shortened it to I.P.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;d like to leave behind the whole &lsquo;debilitated&rsquo; schtick &ndash; and believe me, I would &ndash; then I could stick to the facts. Apparently Hannah Arrendt once said that all art involves motion and that you cannot have motion without space. It&rsquo;s the way these people&rsquo;s heads work. These simple relationships are so hard for me to identify. For instance, the notion that I can&rsquo;t write what I&rsquo;m writing here unless a space opens for me to move these words into is a thing that never would have occurred to me. But it seems like an appropriate formulation. This empty page in front of me is exciting, but also terrifying. I can certainly fill it up with words.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Between doing the dishes and packing up to go to the library, I write. I think things onto paper. I feel my enthusiasm. I&rsquo;m excited to write. I like where I&rsquo;m going. I feel myself growing. But then, a moment later, I feel afraid. The funny thing is, this excitement and this fear are both psychic spaces. They are emotional locations akin to the empty page I see beneath my pen before I write anything down. I feel almost frantic in my attempt to get these words onto paper, to the point that I&rsquo;m not even going to be able to read them when I come back to transcribe them into the computer, they are such a mess, a scrawl of disjointed lines and curlicues. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m trying to arrive at the emptiness that sits at the end of this sentence, but without quite touching that emptiness with the words that continually push the emptiness away so that I can never hope to catch up to it.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I said to Parky on our walk today: &ldquo;I had this crazy dream last night.&rdquo; He remained silent, so I went on. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t quite asleep,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I was at that point where you are starting to not be asleep,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;but you aren&rsquo;t quite awake. I kept thinking about a song by Lynyrd Skynyrd called &lsquo;What&rsquo;s Your Name?&rsquo; </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I wonder if I should use the word &ldquo;actually&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;actually referred to a fight,&rdquo; or if I should just say &ldquo;referred to a fight&rdquo; without prefacing it. The &ldquo;actually&rdquo; was a last-minute addition that came into my head as I was in the midst of writing the sentence in my notebook. It suddenly occurred to me to include &ldquo;actually&rdquo; at the exact moment I arrived at the point in the sentence where it needed to be added. I added it on the fly, as I was writing what was in my head. It was like &ldquo;actually&rdquo; barged into my thoughts as they formed, like a bully that I was afraid to stand up to. When I looked at the word after I&rsquo;d written it, I felt like the &ldquo;actually&rdquo; actually might make it sound like my newly formed interpretation was the correct one. And this is not what I wanted to make happen. I don&rsquo;t feel at all like there is a correct interpretation.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I like that song mainly for the tune. I found it again recently on Apple Music. I have to say, now that I listen to it again, the words really do add a layer to what I feel about the song. Still, I want to be able to say that I like it only for the tune, because the words make me squeamish. I feel like the words actually send a terrible message. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Kitty came downstairs this morning, looked out the living room window, and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s I.P. and Zoomie again.&rdquo; I came out of the kitchen and joined her at the window. I.P. had her head stuffed through the gap under the back gate and she was sniffing away at Zoomie. &ldquo;I guess eight o&rsquo;clock must be Zoomie&rsquo;s walk time,&rdquo; I said. Zoomie&rsquo;s girl seemed more excited than her dog as she tried to pet I.P.&rsquo;s head. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The ebook version of </span><span class="c6 c4">Dad Says He Saw You At The Mall</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;came from a reprint of the book issued by a small U.S. publisher called Mudluscious, run by a guy named J.A. Tyler, that has since closed up. I was hesitant to try to pressure Tyler into reproducing the original layout in the reprint because I knew it would cost him more money. I was just grateful that he was publishing it.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I walked out of the house that day like a man who has only ever dreamt of walking. I was not afraid &ndash; or, at any rate, I did not interpret the deep gulch that had opened inside me as fear. But then, I have a propensity to experience pain as a kind of intense itch, so maybe what I felt that day actually was fear and I just didn&rsquo;t realize it.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I and my aunt Thelma were over visiting my dad not long after he found out he had cancer, and my aunt was talking about somebody named Laura who Dad and she had known when they were kids. As my aunt talked about this Laura person, Dad just sat there in silence. The whole time we were over there visiting, he just sat there like there was no one else in the room with him. He stared off into space, which is what Dad had always done, he&rsquo;d done it since I could remember, even when he wasn&rsquo;t dying of cancer, he&rsquo;d always just sit there staring off into space, not hearing anything you were saying. You&rsquo;d be talking to him and you knew he wasn&rsquo;t hearing a single thing you were saying.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Chris had emailed me that morning asking why the ebook version of </span><span class="c6 c4">Dad Says He Saw You At The Mall</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was not laid out like the original. In the same email, he quoted to me something from the 1927 edition of </span><span class="c6 c4">The World Book</span><span class="c4">. It was the caption for an image of something called a &ldquo;Lincoln Highway Marker&rdquo; and it said: &ldquo;This marker is printed on telegraph poles, barns, fences, or whatever is available, and can be seen readily by the tourist. There will be a marker every 200 feet in addition to those placed at railway crossings and sharp corners of the highway.&rdquo; After explaining to him about how the altered ebook version of </span><span class="c6 c4">Dad Says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;came about, I responded to his Lincoln Highway quote. I told him I thought it was a pretty funny quote and that I figured it must have been a bunch of old men who came up with the marker system so that other old men travelling on the highway wouldn&rsquo;t get caught out by their wives for their lousy sense of direction.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">My Uncle Rennie and his wife Mary Ellen got turned around in Windsor a couple of years back trying to cross over the border into the U.S. and Uncle Rennie just kept driving around until they wound up back where they&rsquo;d started out, still in Windsor. They&rsquo;d been visiting with us for a couple of days and were on their way back home to Florida. In the middle of the night after they left, we got a series of alarming &ndash; in retrospect kind of funny &ndash; texts from my aunt telling us they were lost somewhere in Windsor and that my uncle was refusing to pull over and get directions.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Nineteen seventy-three was the year I used up the ink in three of my pens. That same year, in April, I was in Grand and Toy at the mall and I found a pack of ten pens on sale for a ridiculously low price, so I bought them. Of the ten, I lost four, and three of them were dried out by the time I went to use them.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There were a number of apple orchards near where we lived back when me and Kitty first lived in Richmond Hill. All of them have now shut down to make way for subdivisions. But we used to visit them sometimes when the kids were little and we would pick our own apples. We always picked way too many apples to eat, and then we would have to scramble around trying to find people to give them away to. It always surprised me how many people did not want our apples.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&lsquo;Subdivision&rsquo; is a strange idea. And what about &lsquo;commuting&rsquo;? &lsquo;Commuting&rsquo; is such a weirdly specific form of travel if you think about it. It&rsquo;s something like travelling to a nearby destination with no intention of staying there. And then turning around after eight hours and travelling back home again. And then travelling the next day to the exact same destination, again with no intention of staying.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The management responsibilities for our condominium corporation (which is designated YCC#265, short for York Condominium Corporation #265) just changed hands. We previously had this fairly big company located out in Brampton, but I think they were having a bit of trouble retaining competent staff and our community was suffering for it. At any rate, the new company just sent me a bunch of forms to fill out. So I filled out these forms, scanned them, and emailed them back. I was a little worried that the management company might insist that I send them via snail mail, but I got an email message back from someone at the company named Sandra, thanking me for sending them in.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I still love this pen.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I was vacuuming. Every now and then, I&rsquo;d stop to take a sip of coffee. But whenever I went to take that next sip of coffee, I discovered that I first had to search for my coffee mug, which I&rsquo;d moved to a new location after taking my last sip of coffee. So, in this case, I had to go back to the living room to retrieve my coffee mug. I took a sip of the coffee, then brought the mug into the kitchen, and went back to vacuuming.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The reason I would like to travel into the future is so that I can find out what happens in the end. I mean, I want to know what happens without having to live through all the lousy parts that are bound to come along and plague me in my lifetime. Like as if I were fast forwarding a dumb movie to see the end, or jumping to the last chapter of a book because the first chapter, although badly written, has me wanting to find out what happens in the end. I especially would like to know what happens to my kids in the future, beyond the time when I will presumably be dead.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I love that moment when you turn the vacuum cleaner off and everything seems so quiet.

I gauge that there are probably two more good gulps of coffee left in there. I know that once I&rsquo;ve taken those last two gulps, I&rsquo;ll need to stop drinking coffee for the day, otherwise I&rsquo;ll never get to sleep tonight. I wonder if Mom knew, on that morning when she called from her apartment asking me to drive her to the hospital, that she was drinking her last cup of coffee. She drank so much coffee in her lifetime.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In order to finish vacuuming, I will have to sort out the laundry situation down here in the basement. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s such a mess down here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If Kitty comes home and finds it like this, she won&rsquo;t be happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve just finished pushing a pile of dirty underwear onto the floor in order to clear a space on top of the dryer to use as a makeshift table so I can write these words you are reading right now. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s dark down here in the basement because one of the fluorescent tubes in the ceiling is failing and the light keeps flickering. </span></p><div><p class="c0"><span class="c8"></span></p></div></body></html>

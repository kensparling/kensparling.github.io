I.P. was trying to push her head under the gate at the back of her yard. I.P is the name we&rsquo;ve given to the Samoyed who lives at unit thirty-five. Her real name is Ricecake, but I could never remember that and for some reason I started calling her Ice Pick, which Parky and Deve like, so the name stuck. Eventually, we shortened it to I.P. We don&rsquo;t know Zoomie&rsquo;s real name, or even whether Zoomie is a boy or a girl. We named it Zoomie because it gets the Zoomies in the winter, bounding about like a big white dope chasing after snowballs its master throws for it. Zoomie looks like a Labradoodle. Or what I would imagine a Labradoodle might look like. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve ever actually seen a Labradoodle. I should probably just look it up. My hand is getting really sore from writing in this notebook. I should probably stop. Before I do though, I&rsquo;ll just add that I think Zoomie lives in Unit #8. But it might be #9.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Kitty came downstairs this morning, looked out the living room window, and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s I.P. and Zoomie again.&rdquo; I came out of the kitchen and joined her at the window. I.P. had her head stuffed through the gap under the back gate and she was sniffing away at Zoomie. &ldquo;I guess eight o&rsquo;clock must be Zoomie&rsquo;s walk time,&rdquo; I said. Zoomie&rsquo;s girl seemed more excited than her dog as she tried to pet I.P.&rsquo;s head. She had this trick to get Zoomie to lie down where she would pick its front paws up off the ground and Zoomie would sit its bum down. But Zoomie obviously didn&rsquo;t want to be there. It wanted to get on with its walk. The truth is, I.P. has never really liked people. Anyway, this is what we&rsquo;ve decided, based on our very limited experience of I.P. So I.P. kept sticking her head through the gap at the bottom of the gate while Zoomie just sat in the grass gazing around the neighbourhood, getting up every now and then, intending to continue the walk, until the girl lifted its front paws and made it sit down again. Later that same morning, after Kitty had left for work, I called up from the living room, where I was standing at the back window looking out at the commons: &ldquo;Hey Parky!&rdquo; I called. Parky was in his office upstairs, working. &ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;go look out your mother&rsquo;s bedroom window.&rdquo; I could see I.P. lying in her yard with her head sticking out under the gate.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I still love this pen.</span></p><div><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p></div></body></html>

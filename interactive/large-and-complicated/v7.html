You&rsquo;d have pressed me for more, but I don&rsquo;t think I could even have told you what I meant by &lsquo;debilitated.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t that I was unable, or unwilling to do what I needed, or wanted to do. More like I couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between wanting and needing. So I was having trouble deciding exactly what to do. When I began to confuse my dreams with reality, I decided I had better stop doing everything. I&rsquo;m not talking about suicide. I&rsquo;m saying I felt I needed to impose upon myself the severest of restrictions.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I got up from my reclining chair and prepared to go to the kitchen. </span><span class="c2">I should eat something</span><span class="c4">, I thought, </span><span class="c2">it&rsquo;s getting late.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;But then something outside in the road caught my eye. Two cars, one right behind the other, were sitting in the middle of the roadway, not moving, so that it seemed to me that the one in front must be holding up the other. But it soon became apparent that this was not the case. After a few moments of remaining motionless, the first car turned very slowly into the driveway of the townhouse unit the two cars had stopped in front of. The driveway could hold only one car.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Italics are like letters that are getting blown over by the wind</span><span class="c4">, he thought</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c2">What makes them so weird is that they don&rsquo;t really work all that well when you are writing by hand.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;He shook his head.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And weren&rsquo;t they designed to look like handwriting?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;he asked himself. </span><span class="c2">They must have been invented after printing machines were invented.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Sometimes, when things were going really well, he started to panic. The following Monday, he began his new regime.

I.P. was trying to push her head under the gate at the back of her yard. I.P is the name we&rsquo;ve given to the Samoyed who lives at unit thirty-five. Her real name is Ricecake, but I could never remember that and for some reason I started calling her Ice Pick, which Parky and Deve like, so the name stuck. Eventually, we shortened it to I.P. We don&rsquo;t know Zoomie&rsquo;s real name, or even whether Zoomie is a boy or a girl. We named it Zoomie because it gets the Zoomies in the winter, bounding about like a big white dope chasing after snowballs its master throws for it.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If you&rsquo;d like to leave behind the whole &lsquo;debilitated&rsquo; schtick &ndash; and believe me, I would &ndash; then I could stick to the facts. Apparently Hannah Arrendt once said that all art involves motion and that you cannot have motion without space. It&rsquo;s the way these people&rsquo;s heads work. These simple relationships are so hard for me to identify. For instance, the notion that I can&rsquo;t write what I&rsquo;m writing here unless a space opens for me to move these words into is a thing that never would have occurred to me. But it seems like an appropriate formulation. This empty page in front of me is exciting, but also terrifying. I can certainly fill it up with words. Finding words to fill it with is not really the problem. The real problem is what if I fill it with nothing but crap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Between doing the dishes and packing up to go to the library, I write. I think things onto paper. I feel my enthusiasm. I&rsquo;m excited to write. I like where I&rsquo;m going. I feel myself growing. But then, a moment later, I feel afraid. The funny thing is, this excitement and this fear are both psychic spaces. They are emotional locations akin to the empty page I see beneath my pen before I write anything down. I feel almost frantic in my attempt to get these words down onto paper, to the point that I&rsquo;m not even going to be able to read them when I come back to transcribe them into the computer, they are such a mess, a scrawl of disjointed lines and curlicues, like a pile of pubic hair spread across the bottom of the but after shaving in the tub and then draining the water. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m trying to arrive at the emptiness that sits at the end of this sentence, but without quite touching that emptiness with the words that continually push the emptiness away so that I can never hope to catch up to it. The driving force of the words keeps thrusting me forward into the space I want to become one with in a way that doesn&rsquo;t fill the space, but rather becomes one with it. I don&rsquo;t know how to get to where I want to go, to arrive at where I want to be.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I said to Parky on our walk today: &ldquo;I had this crazy dream last night.&rdquo; He remained silent, so I went on. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t quite asleep,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I was at that point where you are starting to not be asleep,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;but you aren&rsquo;t quite awake. I kept thinking about a song by Lynyrd Skynyrd called &lsquo;What&rsquo;s Your Name?&rsquo; It was like the puzzle dream I always have that I told you about, only in this case I was trying to solve a problem involving a member of the crew mentioned in the song who was &lsquo;having a go with one of the guests.&rsquo; I had always thought that &lsquo;having a go&rsquo; referred to a sexual encounter.&rdquo;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I like that song mainly for the tune. I found it again recently on Apple Music. I have to say, now that I listen to it again, the words really do add a layer to what I feel about the song. Still, I want to be able to say that I like it only for the tune, because the words make me squeamish. I feel like the words actually send a terrible message. I guess what I want is to like the song and at the same time deny the message. I never actually liked the band.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Kitty came downstairs this morning, looked out the living room window, and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s I.P. and Zoomie again.&rdquo; I came out of the kitchen and joined her at the window. I.P. had her head stuffed through the gap under the back gate and she was sniffing away at Zoomie. &ldquo;I guess eight o&rsquo;clock must be Zoomie&rsquo;s walk time,&rdquo; I said. Zoomie&rsquo;s girl seemed more excited than her dog as she tried to pet I.P.&rsquo;s head. She had this trick to get Zoomie to lie down where she would pick its front paws up off the ground and Zoomie would sit its bum down. But Zoomie obviously didn&rsquo;t want to be there.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">There were a number of apple orchards near where we lived back when me and Kitty first lived in Richmond Hill. All of them have now shut down to make way for subdivisions. But we used to visit them sometimes when the kids were little and we would pick our own apples. We always picked way too many apples to eat, and then we would have to scramble around trying to find people to give them away to. It always surprised me how many people did not want our apples. &nbsp;&ldquo;But they are so fresh,&rdquo; I would tell people, &ldquo;we just picked them on Sunday.&rdquo; Still they didn&rsquo;t want them.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The management responsibilities for our condominium corporation (which is designated YCC#265, short for York Condominium Corporation #265) just changed hands. We previously had this fairly big company located out in Brampton, but I think they were having a bit of trouble retaining competent staff and our community was suffering for it. At any rate, the new company just sent me a bunch of forms to fill out. So I filled out these forms, scanned them, and emailed them back. I was a little worried that the management company might insist that I send them via snail mail, but I got an email message back from someone at the company named Sandra, thanking me for sending them in. I emailed back to Sandra, saying that it was my pleasure to send in the forms and that I was looking forward to working with the staff at the new management company. Sandra emailed me back, thanking me again, and wishing me a good day.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I still love this pen.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I was vacuuming. Every now and then, I&rsquo;d stop to take a sip of coffee. But whenever I went to take that next sip of coffee, I discovered that I first had to search for my coffee mug, which I&rsquo;d moved to a new location after taking my last sip of coffee. So, in this case, I had to go back to the living room to retrieve my coffee mug. I took a sip of the coffee, then brought the mug into the kitchen, and went back to vacuuming. That&rsquo;s when I saw, in my peripheral vision, the white swoosh that was Kitty&rsquo;s bathrobe as she moved past me and ascended the stairs. Now I was on my own with the vacuum cleaner and I suddenly felt very lonely for Kitty, and I understood with staggering clarity that I&rsquo;d felt lonely for Kitty even before she&rsquo;d got up and left me alone to vacuum the kitchen.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The reason I would like to travel into the future is so that I can find out what happens in the end. I mean, I want to know what happens without having to live through all the lousy parts that are bound to come along and plague me in my lifetime. Like as if I were fast forwarding a dumb movie to see the end, or jumping to the last chapter of a book because the first chapter, although badly written, has me wanting to find out what happens in the end. I especially would like to know what happens to my kids in the future, beyond the time when I will presumably be dead. But also, I would like to be there when people travel into space and colonize Mars, because that would be so cool. I would, in fact, like to visit Mars. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I love that moment when you turn the vacuum cleaner off and everything seems so quiet. It&rsquo;s the same when the kettle stops boiling. In both cases, there&rsquo;s this intense silence. The silence lasts only a moment before I notice the ringing in my ears that is always there. In some ways, this is why I like to keep so busy with noisy tasks. I just want to escape that constant ringing.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order to finish vacuuming, I will have to sort out the laundry situation down here in the basement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s such a mess down here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If Kitty comes home and finds it like this, she won&rsquo;t be happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve just finished pushing a pile of dirty underwear onto the floor in order to clear a space on top of the dryer to use as a makeshift table so I can write these words you are reading right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s dark down here in the basement because one of the fluorescent tubes in the ceiling is failing and the light keeps flickering. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The pen I am using to write these words in my notebook is a Papermate Inkjoy 300 RT, which, surprisingly, truly is a joy to write with. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After all, doesn&rsquo;t it seem a little bit hyperbolical to name a pen that way. </span></p><div><p class="c5"><span class="c8"></span></p></div></body></html>

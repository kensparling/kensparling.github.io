Our unit, #44, is one of four situated in the middle of the complex. Out our living room window, across the grass commons, we see the west-side units, which back onto the ravine.

The &ldquo;actually&rdquo; was a last-minute addition that came into my head as I was in the midst of writing the sentence in my notebook. It occurred to me just as I arrived at the point in the sentence where it would be added. I added it on the fly, as I was writing what was in my head.
